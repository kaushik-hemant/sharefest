    <h3 class="headLine">Sharefest Privacy Policy: </h3>


    <h4 class="headLine">What information does Sharefest collects and how does it use it?
    </h4>

    <p class="paragraph">
        We do collect some limited information that your browser routinely makes available whenever you visit a website.
        We collect this data to improve the overall quality of the online experience. This information includes your
        Internet Protocol address, the geographic location of the IP address the user is using to access the Internet,
        browser type, browser language and the date and time of your query.

        We do not track which files you share using Sharefest.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        In addition, we may use aggregated information for the purposes of tracking the usage of our services and in
        order to help us develop and improve the service and the software.
    </p>


    <h4 class="headLine">Does Sharefest use user’s local storage?
    </h4>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Local storage (such as IndexDB and FileSystem API) are sandboxed storage spaces which the browser has access to. Sharefest
        may temporarily use visitor's local storage to enable file sharing and saving of content.
        This allow us to handle big files which are too big for the RAM and enable resumable downloads. As mentioned, this
        space is temporary and Sharefest does not have any access to the user’s files. Sharefest cannot delete, modify
        or search files on the user’s hard drive.
    </p>


    <h4 class="headLine">Does Sharefest use user’s cookies?</h4>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Sharefest does not use cookies
        directly, but may include the usage of cookies through 3rd party services that are embedded within the site.
    </p>


    <h4 class="headLine">Which data does Sharefest store about the files I share?</h4>


    <p class="paragraph">
        With every upload the following data is stored in addition to the actual file:

    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        1) SHA3 checksum of the shared file. This DOES NOT include the file data itself. By having the checksum, users are
        able to verify if the file is not tempered. This checksum is not sufficient to reproduce the data itself.

    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        2) Timestamp of the initiate share

    </p>

    <P class="paragraph">
        3) File meta data which may be useful for other users, such as file name, file type, creation data and more. This
        DOES NOT include the file data itself.

    </P>

    <h4 class="headLine">Changes to this Privacy Policy
    </h4>

    <P class="paragraph">
        Sharefest may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your
        personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.

    </P>
